*What is a Factory-Function~

•A factory function can be defined as a function that creates an object and returns it. It is similar to constructor functions/class functions. The factory function is a very useful tool in JavaScript since it returns the object of any class directly.
#Eg.
let john = {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
    getFullName() {
        return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
    }
};

console.log(john.getFullName());

*What is a Constructor-Function~

•A constructor is a function that creates an instance of a class which is typically called an “object”. In JavaScript, a constructor gets called when you declare an object using the new keyword. The purpose of a constructor is to create an object and set values if there are any object properties present.
#Eg.
/* A constructor in Javascript is used to create a new object and set values
for any existing object properties*/

class Animal{
  
  constructor (name, height, weight){
    console.log("created animal named", name)
  }
  nameLength() {
    return name.length;
    
  }
  
}
 var dog = new Animal("Fido", 25, 90);
 var fish = new Animal("Goldie", 2, .02);

	console.log(dog.nameLength);
*What is the Difference Between Factory-Function and Constructor-Functions~

•If a Factory-Function can be defined as a function that creates an object and returns it. It is similar to constructor functions/class functions. The factory function is a very useful tool in JavaScript since it returns the object of any class directly, then the Constructor-Function is a function that creates an instance of a class which is typically called an “object”.
